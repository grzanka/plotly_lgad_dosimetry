# Simulation of monoenergetic beam

## Assumptions

### Physics

Defaults, with 

### Particle transport code

I've used SHIELD-HIT12A v1.0.0 (shieldhit.org/) particle transport code, capable of transport of protons and heavy ions.
It doesn't simulate transport of electrons in medium, energy deposited by electrons in scored in place of their creation.
