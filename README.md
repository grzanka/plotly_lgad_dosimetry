## Working with the code

Create python virtual environment to handle all required dependencies in the project directory:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows activate by running in Powershell: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.
According to stack overflow, you need setuptools>=62 and pip>=21.3 to be able to install the requirements.

We use `requirements.txt` file to specify all required dependencies:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Once you are done deactivate the virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```
